# BibleData

This project's aim is to create an open source heavily cited database from Bible and Christianity related information. Every data is stored in JSON making it easily searchable and convertable to any other more specific data format.

This project is happening in Hungary so most strings are in Hungarian with plans to translate everything to multiple languages. Data structures and source codes are of course written in English.

## Areas

- Christory (proposed): Timeline of Christian and human history.
- BibleTree (in progress): Mapping every person mentioned in the Bible with their geneology and personal data.
- Lists (in progress): Compiled list of specific topics including animals, plants, places, food, materials, professions, nations and a lot more.
- Library (proposed): Structured Bible scripture texts in multiple languages.
- Referencing (proposed): International cross-referencing standard that works for every verse for every Bible translation.
